# StrokersConsortium

Simple addon that combines some of my favorite small addons into one

## PortToStrokersHouse

Small feature that adds a chat command to port to my primary houose which includes:

- Most Mundus Stones
- All Crafting Stations
- Transmutation Station
- Trial Target Dummy
- Aetherial Well

Use `/stroker` in chat!

## EncounterToggle

Small feature that adds the ability to keybind the `/encounterlog` command.

Also alerts to when encounterlog is on or off when entering a dungeon/trial/arena.

Use `/encountertoggle status` to toggle the alert.
